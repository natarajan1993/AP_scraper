          WASHINGTON        (AP) -- The Senate Armed Services Committee has given its approval to President Donald Trump's nominee for Air Force secretary. The GOP-led panel voted 22-5 Wednesday to favorably report Heather Wilson's nomination to the full Senate for consideration. Wilson, a former member of Congress, faced sharp criticism from several Democrats on the committee during her confirmation hearing last week. They questioned her work as a defense industry consultant and a conversation she had a decade ago with a federal prosecutor during a corruption probe. Wilson told the panel she did nothing improper. To avoid potential conflicts of interest, Wilson has committed to selling stocks she holds in more than a dozen companies that have Defense Department contracts. If confirmed, Wilson would be the first Air Force Academy graduate to hold the position. minutes showed Fed officials disagreeing over whether it would be safe to let inflation rise faster and how to deal with the economic impact of President Donald Trump's stimulus proposals.
